# Design Decisions

## 1. Color Scheme
You’ll notice the site is mainly designed with blue, red, and white. These colors aren’t just for aesthetics; they represent important values.  
- **Blue** gives off a sense of trust and professionalism.  
- **Red** brings energy and passion to the design.  
- **White** helps everything feel fresh and balanced, letting the colors stand out without overwhelming the user.  

## 2. Light Effect in the Home Area
The light effect in the home section adds a dynamic touch. It’s subtle but sets the tone for what the website is all about—innovation. It’s like a gentle guide, drawing your attention to the key areas as soon as you land on the page.

## 3. Line Design with Left and Right Elements
In the section **"Design, Build, and Scale Your Vision with Us,"** I used a horizontal line with left and right elements. It’s a simple but effective way to break up the content and make it easier to digest. The line also creates a sense of structure, helping the content flow naturally. It’s all about balance and making the experience feel smooth.

## 4. Our Achievements with Upward Number Animation
For the **Our Achievements** section, I decided to add a number animation that goes up. It’s a fun way to show growth and progress. The rising numbers represent how far we’ve come, and it adds a little something extra to engage users as they see real-time stats.

## 5. Services Section with Red Card Animation
The **Services** section features a red card animation to highlight our offerings. The red here is meant to convey urgency and passion—traits we want to associate with our services. The animation makes each service stand out, drawing the user’s attention in a unique and memorable way.

## 6. Sunset Animation in the About Us Section
In the **About Us** section, there’s a sunset animation. It’s not just a pretty visual; it’s symbolic. The setting sun represents moments of reflection and new beginnings. It’s a calm and peaceful way to transition users into learning more about who we are and what we stand for. A subtle emotional connection that sets the mood for the rest of the story.
